# Digit Recognizer MNIST
Welcome to the Digit Recognizer MNIST project! Our primary goal is to develop a system capable of accurately identifying digits from a large dataset of handwritten images. 
Through the exploration of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we aim to create a robust digit recognition model.


The task involves utilizing two CSV files from the Kaggle competition "Digit Recognizer": https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data  

The training dataset contains 48,000 rows, with each row consisting of an image ID, a label, and 784 pixel values; the test dataset contains 20,000 rows, each comprising 784 pixel values without corresponding labels. 
The objective is to accurately predict the image labels based on the test dataset.
